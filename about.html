                <h1 class="about-main-title">What Copywriting Really Is (And Why You Need It)</h1>

                <p>
                    Copywriting is not just writing. It is the skill of choosing words that move people — to open the email,
                    binge-read the sales page, book the call, hit checkout, and trust you enough to become a client.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a world overflowing with content, attention is the most valuable currency. Most creators and coaches 
                    are not struggling because they lack knowledge or passion. They struggle because their messaging isn’t 
                    clear enough, strong enough, or strategic enough to cut through the noise.
                </p>

                <h2 class="about-subheading">Why Copywriting Matters</h2>

                <p>
                    Good copy does three things extremely well:
                </p>

                <ul class="about-list">
                    <li>It grabs attention immediately (before people scroll away).</li>
                    <li>It builds trust and emotion so your readers feel understood.</li>
                    <li>It makes taking the next step feel natural and exciting — not pushy.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This is why businesses that invest in copywriters grow faster.  
                    Clear copy equals clear conversions. And clear conversions equal more clients, more sales, and more freedom.
                </p>
