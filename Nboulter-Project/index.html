                <h2 class="about-heading">ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Natalie Boulter. I am a just an Arizona girl 🌵 who fell in love with writing. 
                <p>
    I believe business works best when it’s built on connection.
</p>

<p>
    I help coaches, creators, and small business owners communicate with more confidence.
    Sometimes that looks like email sequences. Other times it’s a sales page, a funnel,
    a story that needs shaping, or messaging that finally feels like “you.”
</p>

<p>
    I love what I do because it lets me blend creativity with strategy while working with
    people who genuinely care about the impact they make. You bring the vision. I help
    translate it into words that move people.
</p>

<p class="about-note">
    When I'm not working, you’ll probably find me with a Dr. Pepper in hand, eating sushi,
    or chasing Arizona sunsets.
