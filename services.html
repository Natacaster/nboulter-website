        <p class="services-lead">
            Whether you want to nurture your audience, launch a new offer, or grow without burning out,
            I help you turn words into revenue with email funnels, sales pages, captions, SMS copy,
            and everything in between.

            <h2>Email Funnels</h2>
            <p>
               Email isn't optional. According to your portfolio (page 3), email builds trust, multiplies sales,
               and works while you sleep. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
               I craft onboarding sequences, weekly relationship builders, and full sales sequences
               that nurture, educate, warm your audience, and convert at scale.
            </p>

        <div class="service-card">
            <h2>Weekly & Launch Emails</h2>
            <p>
                Your weekly emails keep you top-of-mind between launches.  
                Your sales sequence drills into objections, desire, urgency, and belief building.

        <div class="service-card">
            <h2>Sales Page Copy</h2>
            <p>
                You have seconds to grab attention. I write clear, emotional, structured long-form or short-form pages
                that guide readers effortlessly from curiosity to checkout.

        <div class="service-card">
            <h2>SOS Social Media Captions</h2>
            <p>
                No more guessing what to say. I write captions that increase connection, deepen trust, and help your 
                ideal clients binge your content instead of scrolling past it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-card">
            <h2>SMS Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                High-converting texts people ACTAULLY want to read!  
                Short, punchy, and strategic so your audience opens, replies, and buys!
